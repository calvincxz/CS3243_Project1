## Objectives
The aims of this project are to:
1. Become familiar with the implementation of uninformed and informed search algorithms
through their application on a simple problem.
2. Analyse the correctness and complexity of the aforementioned search algorithms.
3. Design experiments to further empirically evaluate the aforementioned search algorithms.
4. Discuss the effectiveness of the implemented algorithms on the k-puzzle problem.
